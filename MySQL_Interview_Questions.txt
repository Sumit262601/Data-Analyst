‚öôÔ∏è Indexes, Views, Constraints
------------------------------
12. What is an Index?

üìä Advanced Concepts
--------------------
16. What is Normalization?

17. What is Denormalization?
    - Combining tables for performance at the cost of redundancy.

18. Difference between TRUNCATE and DELETE?
    - DELETE is DML (can filter); TRUNCATE is DDL (faster, removes all rows).

19. Difference between UNION and UNION ALL?
    - UNION removes duplicates; UNION ALL keeps all rows.

20. What are Stored Procedures and Triggers?
    - Stored Procedure: A stored SQL block.
    - Trigger: Auto-executed SQL on table events.

21. What are Transactions?
